# MyNotes
Notes app to save the most important notes on your phone. One of my smaller projects,
it uses CoreData to save and fetch the created notes.
It allows the user to create notes via the add button.
Delete notes by sliding the cell to the left and delete or reset the entire app.

# Running

Enjoy!
